# Multi-Function-Program
### This program creates and presents the user with a menu of multiple functions, and performs the desired function upon the user's input
The program allows the user to choose from a displayed menu to create a password, find the percentage of a fraction, display the number of days from a future date, calculate the leg (Side C) of a triangle, calculate the volume of a right circular cylinder or exit the program. Five functions are defined in the program to perform the functions in the menu, pass_gen, percent_calc, days_from, side_calc and vol_calc.
